This is a webapp which enable users to take short notes and pin it on their view screen, it has mostly all the functionality a traditional sticky note used for note taking has, for instance it can be dragged and dropped anywhere across the user's viewport.

I might consider adding user authentication and a long term storage for deleted notes so as to eneable it to be restored after deletion

```js
export const JustAnotherProject = () => {

};
